PreRelease-SectorEngine
=======================
This version is currently out dated and should not be downloaded, the next version will be a release and can be found at https://github.com/siliconincorporated/SectorEngine
Hang in there while I finish off version 1.0.0

###EDIT: Sector Engine is no longer in development. This repo stands in memory of a sad attempt at a game engine.

What to expect:
---------------
Level Editor, 
Improved camera, 
Super awesome demo, 
BIS (Built in shaders) including toon and landscape shaders, 
And more to come

This repo will be deleted whenever Sector Engine 1.0.0 is released, as of now, it stands as a preview
